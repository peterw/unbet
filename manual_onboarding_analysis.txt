Reference Screenshots (27 screens) - Appears to be a more comprehensive flow with:
- Multiple welcome/intro screens with visual storytelling
- More detailed user profiling questions
- Progress indicators throughout
- Educational content interspersed
- Social proof elements
- Motivational messaging
- Habit formation questions
- Commitment/pledge screens
- Community features introduction
- Success stories/testimonials
- Personalized plan preview
- Premium features showcase

=== KEY IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED ===

**1. CRITICAL CHANGES (Implement Immediately)**

a) Visual Hierarchy & Branding
- Current: Generic dark theme lacks personality
- Needed: Consistent brand colors (suggest: Deep blue #1E3A5F as primary, accent color #5B8DFF)
- Implementation: Update Colors.ts with new palette, apply throughout onboarding

b) Welcome Flow Enhancement
- Current: Single welcome screen
- Needed: 3-4 screen storytelling sequence explaining the journey
- Implementation: Add carousel or swipeable intro screens with compelling visuals

c) Progress Visualization
- Current: Simple progress bar at top
- Needed: More prominent progress indicator with step numbers
- Implementation: Create custom ProgressIndicator component with steps visualization

d) Copy & Messaging
- Current: Technical/functional copy ("Choose your Gender", "How old are you?")
- Needed: Empathetic, motivational copy that addresses user's journey
- Examples:
  - "Let's personalize your journey" instead of "Choose your Gender"
  - "Every journey starts with understanding you better" instead of "How old are you?"
  - "Your commitment level?" instead of "Training frequency"

**2. HIGH PRIORITY CHANGES (This Week)**

a) Add Educational Context
- Insert brief educational screens between input steps explaining why each piece of info matters
- Example: After age input, show "Why age matters: Recovery patterns change as we grow"

b) Social Proof Integration
- Add testimonial cards or success metrics
- "Join 50,000+ men reclaiming their lives"
- Include brief success stories between major sections

c) Commitment & Accountability
- Add a "pledge" or commitment screen before sign-up
- Include options for accountability partners or check-ins
- Consider adding notification preferences setup

d) Visual Polish
- Add subtle animations between screens (fade/slide transitions)
- Include more icons and visual elements
- Use gradient backgrounds or patterns to add depth

**3. MEDIUM PRIORITY CHANGES (Within 2 Weeks)**

a) Personalization Preview
- Before sign-up, show a preview of their personalized plan
- "Based on your inputs, here's what your journey looks like..."

b) Community Features Introduction
- Add screens showcasing community support features
- Anonymous forums, progress sharing, milestone celebrations

c) Gamification Elements
- Introduce streak counters, badges, or milestone concepts
- Show potential achievements they can unlock

d) Emergency Support Features
- Introduce panic button or urge surfing tools
- Quick access to support when needed

  { key: 'welcome2', type: 'carousel' },
  { key: 'welcome3', type: 'carousel' },
  
  // Personal info with context
  { key: 'personalIntro', type: 'education' },
  { key: 'gender', type: 'input' },
  { key: 'age', type: 'input' },

];
```

**Step 4: Enhanced Copy Examples**

const enhancedCopy = {
  welcome: {
