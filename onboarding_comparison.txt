Of course. Which of the onboarding screenshots from the `core_app_onboarding` directory would you like me to analyze?


=== ONBOARDING SCREEN 1 ===

Loaded cached credentials.

Based on the image provided:

1.  **Main UI Elements:** The screen features a large headline, a smaller tagline, a prominent call-to-action button, and a secondary login link. A large, stylized graphic of a glowing orb dominates the bottom portion of the screen.
2.  **Purpose:** This is a welcome screen for a mobile app called "Seed." Its purpose is to introduce the app to new users and funnel them into the onboarding process ("Start my journey") or allow existing users to sign in.
3.  **Text/Messaging:** The text reads "Welcome to Seed" and "Unleash your Potential. Leave Porn Behind." This messaging clearly positions the app as a tool for self-improvement, specifically for overcoming pornography addiction.
4.  **Design Style:** The design is modern, sleek, and minimalist, utilizing a dark theme with a deep blue and black color palette. High-contrast white text and a vibrant blue/purple gradient for the button and graphic create a focused, aspirational feel, complemented by a subtle starry background.
